Rusty Sledge is the poorest child in his class, and the smallest. He is also the brightest. For these reasons, his classmates pick on him, beat him up, and bully him to the brink of suicide. His only ally is Raven, a girl in his class. When his dad tells him to fight back or face a beating from him, Rusty makes the only weapon at his disposal, a sock full of pennies. With it, he levels the playing field and his overgrown tormentors. Then with the help of three mentors, a school teacher, an old coal mine operator, and a West Virginia State Trooper, he turns his sock full of pennies into an international coal mining entity that he uses to go after corporate bullies, and crush a ruthless coal cartel and their illegitimate union. During this time, Raven's family moves to Ghana, Africa on a religious mission. After saving the lives of his co-workers during a mine disaster, Rusty becomes a hero. She sees him on the news in Ghana and contacts him. They find each other and realize they're still in love, get married, and have a son. Rusty's nemesis, Barry Buckley, becomes obsessed with causing their demise to get even with him. This story will grab you and keep you in Rusty’s world until you read the last ironic word, and leave you with the knowledge that love conquers all, and if you meet adversity head-on, it truly does get better. Remember, do unto others as you would have others do unto you. If you don’t, they may have a sock full of pennies.
