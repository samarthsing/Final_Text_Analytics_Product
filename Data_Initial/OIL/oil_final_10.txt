Veteran CIA operative Jack Wilder is called upon to discreetly investigate the assassination of a high level OPEC oil analyst on the verge of announcing a startling discovery. More complications arise when the body of Wilder’s best friend, also an oil analyst, is found in a field on the outskirts of Houston. Wilder questions his own judgment, which he fears is being clouded by the death of his friend, and his disdain for the friend’s widow. Stonewalled at every turn, the CIA sleuth struggles to find motives for the two murders. Matters become more complex when he finds himself falling in love, or is it lust, with a beautiful Software Engineer. More bodies begin to fall as Wilder gets closer to discovering the truth.
