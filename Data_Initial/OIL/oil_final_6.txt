"He had to keep it together two more years. That was the plan. 
Then just maybe he could turn things around. Clayton was thoughtful as he dipped a curly fry into a tiny tub of ketchup. His hands were clean, the nails scrubbed white as wax. He was one of the thousands of plaid-shirted workers drawn like iron filings to the magnet of North Dakota, each with a story and a dream."

Much has been written about every aspect of the Bakken oil boom--the dirt, the danger, the exploitation, the money. Every aspect but love. Hard Road Home explores the aftermath of a chance encounter between two people, each driven by their own demons as they forge ahead toward very different dreams.

When shy receptionist, Amanda Swenson, meets lonesome trucker, Clayton Sloan, an intense new longing awakens in her. Clayton has only one thing on his mind as he hauls oil eighty hours a week: earn enough cash to save the family farm—-and his legacy. Women are a distant second. Can the redheaded receptionist push beyond her doubts and fears to slow down the tight-lipped trucker long enough for him to notice her? Will her beauty and new-found boldness be enough to break through the wall of secrecy around him? Set in western North Dakota against the harsh, unrelenting demands of the Bakken oil boom, this lusty coming-of-age romance explores the age-old stirrings of the heart.

Poignant and sensual, Hard Road Home tells a compelling story about the power of love to open hearts and transform lives.
