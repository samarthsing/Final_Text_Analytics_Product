Hydraulic fracturing, often called fracking, is a drilling technique that accesses previously inaccessible oil/gas reserves. Although the process could aid U.S. energy independence, it is controversial and public opinion is divided. Guided by agenda-setting and framing, this study content analyses news coverage of fracking (N = 524) across cable networks (CNN, Fox News, MSNBC). Results show cable news lacks substance and relies on thematic framing. While all networks failed to provide factual information, issue-related topics discussed and sources used vary ideologically. Theoretical and practical implications, which include the potential for priming audiences and influencing future behaviors and judgments, are discussed.
Hydraulic fracturing, commonly referred to as fracking, is a technique that allows extractive companies to access oil and gas deposits that would otherwise be inaccessible [1]. To accomplish this, a large volume of water and proppants are injected deep into the ground to fracture the energy-bearing rock below, resulting in the extraction of oil and natural gas [2]. Use of this process has increased in the last decade with the addition of multidirectional drilling [3]. Amid fluctuating global energy prices, fracking now accounts for about a half of U.S. crude oil production, two-thirds of U.S. natural gas production, and is instrumental to making the U.S. energy independent in the future [4].

Although fracking is increasingly practiced in the U.S., the process remains controversial [5] due to limited knowledge regarding long-term consequences and environmental implications [6], [7]. Such concerns include the irrecoverable loss of water used in the process, air pollution, groundwater contamination, uncontrolled methane gas releases, and increased risk of seismic activity, just to name a few [8], [9], [10].

As with many controversial issues, public opinion on fracking is divided along partisan lines [1], [6], [11], [12]. It has been speculated that opinions on fracking may be divided based on geographical proximity to areas where it is practiced. However, investigation into the opinions of residents in three U.S. states where fracking occurs found that, regardless of geographic proximity, political partisanship and other pre-existing attitudes were the greatest predictors of whether individuals support placing a moratorium on fracking [13]. Further, U.S. conservatives are more supportive of fracking than are liberals [14]. Therefore, fracking presents an ideal opportunity to examine reporting, which may contribute to the ideological divide on the issue. Previous research has examined how fracking is presented on social media [7], [15] and print news [16]. There is also evidence of increased media attention to hydraulic after the release of Gasland, a documentary film on the issue [5]. To date, no study has examined the portrayal of fracking on U.S. cable news, which consciously markets to ideological viewpoints [17]. Although all news outlets exhibit little variation in regard to story topics, cable news outlets tend to spin issues in ways that vary across ideological divides [17]. Examination of the continued controversy regarding fracking, which has prompted increased media and public attention, can shed light on potential implications that ideologically slanted reporting has for public opinion [6].

Guided by agenda-setting and framing, the current study examines presentation of fracking and associated prominent issues, the sources utilized in stories, and the manner in which fracking is portrayed across cable news outlets. Through a systematic examination of all existent news stories covering fracking on U.S. cable news outlets, this work further focuses on how news outlets that aim to promote ideologically consistent points of view convey information on this topic to audiences.
Hydraulic fracturing refers to the “unconventional” process used in the extraction of natural gas and oil that is dispersed in rock [18]. Fractures are produced in rocks by drilling vertically and extending with horizontal or directional sections to stimulate the flow of energy resources. Using these wells, high pressure proppants are injected into the ground to force gas out of fissures [19]. Commonly referred to as “fracking,” terminology that may trouble experts because true fracking is only one stage in the process [20], the term is often equated with the entire process. Fracking was first experimentally employed in the 1940s before becoming commercially viable [21]. Since, tens of thousands of wells have been drilled [22], with the Marcellus Shale in Northern Appalachia currently producing over 18 billion cubic feet of gas daily [4]
American public opinion on fracking has been difficult to gauge, due in part to limited knowledge. The U.S. population has been found to have limited awareness of fracking, yet those familiar with fracking are more likely to support its use [11]. Overall, however, there is greater opposition than support (e.g., [11], [12], [23]). Recent studies have shed more light on conflicting opinions. For instance, a key determinant of opinion is political ideology [1], [6]. Specifically, liberals harbor more negative attitudes toward fracking than conservatives [1].

In spite of strong opinions on both sides, there remains a high level of ignorance about fracking [1], [24]. Furthermore, an individual's support or opposition can be influenced by the structure of the argument. For example, it has been found that informing audiences of the economic benefits of fracking can increase support, while messaging emphasizing environmental costs may decrease support [25]. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the factual aspects of the fracking process that are reported to audiences along with the costs and benefits that are emphasized on various partisan platforms. The current study assesses aspects of news presentations that work to provide a formal definition of fracking. As such, descriptions of the fracking process in news content are evaluated against a definitional measure of fracking based on information contained in peer-reviewed journal articles, energy policy documents, and reports from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and Environmental Protection Agency [3], [18], [26], [27]. The following research question addresses the depth of definitional information presented:
RQ1: How thorough of a definition of fracking do networks report to audiences?
American cable news channels are popular information sources and, as a result of their proliferation, viewers encounter increased access to partisan political voices [28]. Although cable subscription has decreased over the last few years, combined average viewership, total revenues, and profits have reportedly grown among the three major cable news channels [29].

Reporting on cable news is known to be different than what is on broadcast networks [30]. Cable news has provided audiences with a unique ability to “ideologically customize” the information to which they are exposed in a way that is unparalleled by print and broadcast news sources [31]. Unlike American broadcast networks, cable news outlets are especially accustomed to spin politics and ideological issues [17] and their audiences tend to be split along similar ideological/partisan lines [32]. For example, Fox News has been found to present a distinct pro-Republican conservative stance [33]. As such, conservatives tend to be Fox News viewers while liberals attend more to MSNBC and CNN [32]. Review of issue-specific news coverage has further demonstrated ideological differences. For instance, in covering the environment, Fox News was found to dismiss climate change and feature sources who question the veracity of scientific claims, unlike CNN and MSNBC [34]. Because individuals’ opinions about fracking are closely linked ideology, it makes sense to examine how fracking is framed by cable news outlets [35].

In addition to differences in reporting techniques, implications for audiences have been found to differ. For example, cable news viewers have been found to exhibit a preference to interact with like-minded individuals on partisan-divided issues [32]. Moreover, conservatives and liberals tend to avoid news from the opposite side, even when content does not cover partisan-divided issues [36]. Further, Fox News viewers are reportedly more distrusting of other outlets [32]. Cable news networks are not constrained by the same boundaries of objectivity that have historically shaped print and broadcast news [31]. In regard to effects, research found slanted coverage shapes Fox News viewers’ non-acceptance of global warming while viewers of CNN and MSNBC are more accepting [34]. Such ideological fragmentation makes cable news unique from print/broadcast and the polarizing effect of news treatment have implications for public opinion. Therefore, examination of cable news coverage on fracking can shed light on potential implications that ideologically slanted reporting has for public opinion and policy [6].
Media audiences are the recipients of carefully tailored messages that selectively reflect reality [37]. This process of selective presentation, also known as framing, influences audiences’ perceptions of what constitutes a problem, guides interpretation and evaluation of issues, and influences what solutions are recommended [38], [39]. By defining and promoting certain audience interpretations, framing shapes the parameters by which individuals engage in evaluation of an issue/object, their appraisals, decisions, and subsequent action [40]. Therefore, framing provides a suitable framework for examining news coverage on fracking.

An approach referred to as the social construction of technology considers science and technology as artifacts whose meanings are socially constructed through discourse, which can guide interpretation of new technologies and their acceptance or rejection [41]. Social actors interested in technological innovations negotiate the meaning and implications of innovations through discourse [42]. In some cases, conflicting discourses may result in innovations being viewed as controversial while convergent discourses may lead to consensus, which may result in stabilization and closure, or the acceptance of innovations [41]. Innovations that have attained widespread acceptance (i.e., closure) are less open to reframing [43]. However, novel innovations are most open to being contested and advocacy groups struggle to dominate framing and influence policy [42], [44].

Despite the fact that hydraulic fracturing is not a new technology, its use is increasingly widespread and has become contested in media and political discourse [45]. Research indicates that conflicting frames dominate discourses about shale gas exploration, highlighting either threat or opportunity. Threat narratives raise concerns on topics such as environmental degradation and lack of policies regulating extractive activities while opportunity narratives emphasize economic growth and energy security [46], [47]. These contrasting narratives are championed, on one hand, by coalitions including environmental groups and community members and, on the other hand, by extractive companies and private sector actors [46].

Conflicting frames are also prominent in media coverage of hydraulic fracturing across different national contexts, heightening uncertainty about its use [48], [49]. These media frames guide acceptance or rejection of hydraulic fracturing in concert with individuals’ existing interpretive frames [50]. For example, a comparative study of the interpretive framing of shale exploration across Bulgaria, Poland, and Romania uncovered frames including national security concerns and economic opportunities [45]. The national security frame emphasizes the risk of depending on Russia for energy, which was evident across the three countries. Goldthau and Sovacool [45] also highlight the framing of shale as a bridge fuel and environmental boon on one hand, or as detrimental to the environment on the other.

While the examination of frames specific to the context of hydraulic fracturing has contributed to our understanding, the employment of context-specific frames (e.g., opportunity frames, threat frames) limits their applicability to other issues. Specifically, context-specific frames change meaning across different contexts [51] and may result in the inability to compare results across framing studies [52], [53]. Conversely, context-transcendent frames are applicable across a variety of issues and consistently demonstrate similar effects [51]. As such, the current study investigates the use of context-transcendent frames, prominent among which is episodic and thematic framing [54], [55], [56].

Iyengar [54] found the use of episodic and thematic frames in news stories can differently contextualize issues, which subsequently influence perceptions of the issue at hand. Episodic and thematic frames are distinguishable based on their opposing presentation concerning the attribution of responsibility. Episodic frames are identified through their emphasis on individuals and isolated events. Through this approach, news stories present issues through the lens of individual experience. On the other hand, thematic frames tend to focus on overarching issues, provide depth and background, and emphasize society rather than individual experience [54], [56]. As a result, episodic frames lead to individual attribution of responsibility, while thematic frames result in attribution of societal responsibility for causes and solutions to problems [57]. Indeed, exposure to thematic framing of environmental news has been found to increase support for policy change regarding climate change [58].

Originating in a political communication context, episodic frames were said to dominate television news [54], [56]. While episodic and thematic framing have been used to investigate many topics, they have not been strongly utilized in studies related to science and environmental communication [59]. The over-reliance on issue frames that are context-specific hinders comparison among studies. Although somewhat limited, research has begun to examine news coverage of environmental and energy-related issues through episodic and thematic frames. For instance, Haigh [60] found news stories about the Keystone XL Pipeline were dominated by thematic frames. Application of episodic and thematic framing has also been applied to hydraulic fracturing. Newspaper stories on fracking and earthquakes in Oklahoma, an area where the process is practiced, found episodic frames were more common in local outlets [61]. However, the same study found national outlets relied more on thematic frames. Given the focus of the current study on nationally broadcast cable news stories, the following hypothesis is posed:
H1: Thematic frames will appear more than episodic frame in news about fracking across outlets.
The agenda-setting theory posits that media have the ability to set the public agenda by conferring prominence upon specific topics, which then causes audiences to perceive those topics as more important than others [62]. In essence, news coverage, which is a manifestation of the priorities of the press, set the agenda for public thought and become the priorities of the public [63]. Therefore, the mass media play a key role in opinion formation by setting the agenda of public discourse [64].

Specifically, agenda-setting contends that the media confers prominence upon issues through indicators of media emphasis. Such indicators include the frequency of reporting, story placement, and other content cues such as number of sources or inclusion of multimedia content [62]. Agenda-setting is particularly applicable to the issue of fracking considering its controversial nature, a characteristic that drives media coverage. Moreover, the relative novelty of fracking as an extractive process and the potential impact of fracking position the issue as a “hot topic” for media organizations [65]. In fact, these attributes are especially relevant to media coverage of new technologies which may have environmental implications.
While research on the portrayal of fracking in the media is limited, various media channels have been examined. Investigation of fracking-related news coverage includes examination newspapers [5], [66], [67], social media [15], [68], websites [69], [70], and policy documents [5]. These studies found that while media attention has increased, the issues presented in the coverage of hydraulic fracturing remain a central source of controversy. For instance, in European newspapers, news was identified as either pro-fracking or anti-fracking based on whether they constructed a narrative that either presented fracking as a clean energy source or oppositional to clean energy [67].

Existing work has also found increased attention paid to fracking in local newspapers [66] and both national newspapers and television [5]. However, the observed increases were sparked by specific fracking-related incidents and the release of Gasland, a documentary about fracking. Alongside increased media attention, public interest, based on the frequency of Google searches on the topic, has also risen [5]. The release of Gasland, which focused on negative impact of fracking, and its Academy Award nomination contributed to mobilizing anti-fracking movements [5], [68].

As agenda-setting is topic based, the issues discussed in the content of newscasts about fracking are particularly important for the current analysis. Issues discussed in fracking-related news programming gain prominence among audiences, making those topics more readily available in the minds of viewers. Subsequently, the presentation of issues primes audiences when they later make issue judgments.

Based on the key topics discussed in past research, a selection of issue categories was chosen to be examined in the current manuscript. For instance, previous research has indicated that fracking is surrounded by controversy, especially as it relates to economic and environmental concerns [1], [71]. Policy related to hydraulic fracturing was also selected as an issue subcategory and was developed in consultation with others’ investigation of how actors use media to advocate for policy enactment [66], [70].

Advocates often cite the positive impact on the economy through the creation of jobs and the prospect of energy independence [72]. Additional economic benefits often highlighted include economic development of local communities where extractive companies operate [46], [69], [72]. Other studies report specific economic benefits including energy independence, cleaner energy, and revenue from taxation of extractive companies (e.g., [3], [6], [45]). In fact, news coverage of shale gas exploration has also been found to discuss benefits such as jobs, leases and royalties paid by fracking companies [73]. These aspects, as well as real estate gains and other general economic benefits were selected for examination. Additionally, economic costs associated with fracking emerged from preliminary review of transcripts and were also included.

The issues emphasized that relate to health and the environment also play a role in the formation of public opinion. For instance, Matz and Renfrew [69] examined issues present in strategic discourses on fracking by pro and anti-fracking actors and found the energy industry often cites compelling images depicting environmentally friendly extraction. Proponents also boast that water used in the process can be recycled [9]. Gas obtained from shale, a form of sedimentary rock often fracked for natural gas, is also advertised as a clean form of energy, making it environmentally preferable [6]. Therefore, an issue subcategory related to environmental benefits was developed to capture such discussions.

On the other hand, others have claimed that these benefits are greatly overstated and outweighed by other social and environmental consequences [3]. Opponents argue that the practice has a disastrous environmental impact, including pollution of ground-water by chemicals used in the process, which are often disposed of underground and risk of seismic activity [9], [16]. Additionally, there have been claims that contaminated ground-water has negative effects on health [66].

In their examination of newspapers in three U.S. states experiencing an increase in fracking, Davis and Hoffer [66] found environmental or health problems associated with fracking were presented in more than half of articles. Such detrimental issues included discussion of air pollution, contaminated water, and road damage due to traffic. Similar findings were noted in New York and Pennsylvania newspapers, with water contamination featuring as a key environmental consequence [73]. Therefore, issues reflecting environmental consequences were created following Ladd's [3] analysis of fracking narratives obtained from interviews and Habib and Hinojosa's [16] analysis of U.S. newspapers. This includes consequences such as water contamination, air pollution, seismic activity, risks to human health, and other environmental risks. Based on these categories, the following research question was posed:
RQ2: How does the presentation of issues vary across cable news outlets?
Information sources play a vital role in the construction of media narratives and shape the manner in which news is framed by bringing unique perspectives to bear upon public understanding [74]. Some scholars, however, argue that rather than shaping media content, sources are merely used by media organizations to reinforce their ideological positions [75]. In other words, sources are deliberately selected to strengthen the positioning of an issue. Reporting is often dominated by powerful sources [75], [76]. In reporting the environment, however, it is recommended that environmental regulatory bodies, such as the EPA, as well as experts and other credible, non-partisan sources be used [77]. Additionally, they also call for the use of a variety of sources in order to ensure that diverse positions are expressed.
RQ3: How do sources relied upon in fracking coverage vary across cable news outlets?
Data originated from a census of cable news transcripts from three U.S. cable news outlets (i.e., CNN, Fox News, MSNBC). Using Lexis-Nexis Academic Universe database, a search was conducted for transcripts featuring “fracking” or “hydraulic fracturing” in the text of the transcript. This search returned all stories appearing in newscasts between 2010 and 2017. Transcripts were collected by selecting “sources” > “news” > “news transcripts.” The search was set to collect transcripts from the previous ten-year period and the earliest story on each network appeared in 2010. This retrieved 956 transcripts (CNN: 396, Fox News: 381; MSNBC: 179) and each was reviewed by both of the independent coders to ensure fit. Transcripts were predominately removed for misuse of the term “fracking,” such as using the term to refer to lewd acts, or for only mentioning the topic as a lead-in for a story that would be aired at a later date/time. This led to the census of usable news transcripts that were coded for this analysis (N = 524; CNN: 195, Fox News: 215, MSNBC: 114)
Using singular transcripts as the unit of analysis, coding categories included definition, issues, sources, and frame. Two coders independently coded transcripts. First, coders were provided with transcripts and instructed to read through each transcript before coding. Coders were also instructed to reread the transcript and code for definition, issues, and sources, each of which were coded for presence/absence. Finally, coders were instructed to make an overall assessment to code for frame.

The definition of fracking was assessed based on factual descriptive information provided to news audiences. The depth of the definition was evaluated by coding for presence or absence for mentions of: (a) fracking as a method of oil or gas extraction; (b) the application of horizontal and/or multi-directional drilling; (c) the use of proppants in the process; (d) estimates of oil/gas reserves; (e) post-fracking activities; and (f) historical information on the process. Using this assessment, a six-point additive scale assessed the depth of the formal definition used to inform audiences.

Based on fracking-related content within news stories, each issue referenced in a transcript was coded as present/absent and included mention of: (a) presenting fracking as controversial; (b) actual/proposed policy on the topic; (c) job growth resulting from the practice; (d) mention of the potential for energy independence/security as a result of fracking; (e) general economic benefits, such as increased real estate value or foreign investments; (f) economic costs associated with fracking; (g) environmental benefits, such as reporting fracking as harmless to the environment; (h) risks of seismic activity; (i) air pollution; (j) water contamination; (k) health risks linked to the process; and (l) other environmental risks, such as threats to wildlife.

Coding for source consisted of indicating individuals, other than the news anchor that spoke explicitly about fracking in the transcript. Transcripts were coded to reflect the inclusion of all speaking sources categorized as: (a) government sources; (b) energy industry employees; (c) outside experts, not associated with the government or energy industry; (d) citizens, including individuals, activists, and celebrities speaking about fracking; and (e) journalists and others, reflecting others used as an information source on the topic.

After being coded for all other categories, a final decision was recorded for frame. Using references within the news story, transcripts were coded as either: (a) episodic, reflected in stories that discussed isolated events, focused on discrete cases, and emphasized individual responsibility; (b) thematic, identified in stories that focused on the broader societal context, relied on expert analysis, or emphasized broader social/institutional responsibility; or (c) both/not identified, seen in transcripts that presented both frames equally or lacked enough content to determine a frame.
In order to determine the reliability of coding categories, a subset of 40 stories were randomly selected and coded. The pre-test resulted in low intercoder reliability scores, specifically Krippendorf's alpha values were definition (.67), issue (.76), source (.62), and frame (.62). As a result, operational definitions were improved. Consequent upon these changes, a separate subset of 45 stories, representing 10% of the sample, was used to calculate intercoder reliability. Final Krippendorf's alpha values were definition .90 (98.9%), issue .82 (95%), source .82 (96%), and frame .87 (92.2%).
RQ1 asked whether cable news outlets differed in their treatment of defining and explaining fracking to audiences. Data analysis revealed a significant main effect of network on depth of definition, F(2, 521) = 21.88, p < .001; ηp2 = .08. An SNK post hoc analysis revealed that stories discussing fracking on CNN (M = 1.03, SD = 1.21) provided audiences with a significantly more in-depth definition of the process than did stories on MSNBC (M = .77, SD = 1.02). Further, stories on CNN and MSNBC both provided a significantly more in-depth definition of fracking than did Fox News (M = .38, SD = .76).

H1 predicted that thematic frames would appear more prominently than episodic frames in cable news stories on fracking. H1 was addressed through a cross-tabs analysis that revealed a significant difference in the frequency of frames across cable networks (χ2 (4, N = 524) = 23.94, p < .001). As seen in Table 1, all networks were found to use thematic framing more often than episodic framing. Therefore, H1 was supported. However, z-test of proportion revealed that MSNBC differed significantly in their use of frames. Specifically, MSNBC presented a greater proportion of episodically framed news (37.7%) than did CNN (21%) or Fox News (14.4%). Conversely, MSNBC presented a significantly smaller proportion of thematically framed news (58.8%) than did CNN (75.4%) or Fox News (80.9%)
RQ2 asked how the presentation of issues in news coverage of fracking varies across cable news outlets. Cross-tabs analysis suggests the reporting of fracking-related issues significantly varied across outlets (χ2 (20, N = 1133) = 216.25, p < .001). The exception was the consistently limited portrayal of economic costs across networks (CNN 5.3%; Fox News 3.1%; MSNBC 3.5%). As seen in Table 2, coverage on Fox News significantly differed from other channels on a variety of topics. Specifically, z-test of proportion revealed that stories on Fox News devoted more coverage to job growth (18%), energy independence (25.2%), and general economic benefits (16.5%) than did coverage on CNN (9.4%, 9.4%, 10.1%, respectively) and MSNBC (3.5%, 8.7%, 6.3%, respectively). In a similar vein, stories on Fox News contained significantly fewer mentions of seismic activity (.5%), water contamination (6.4%), human health risks (1%), and other environmental risks (2.3%) than did coverage on CNN (9.9%, 13.6%, 4.2%, 5.7%, respectively) and MSNBC (7.3%, 16%, 8.3%, 9.4%, respectively).
RQ3 asked whether cable news networks differed in their reliance on sources of information in coverage of fracking. Cross-tabs analysis suggests that the utilization of sources significantly differed across networks (χ2 (8, N = 383) = 23.94, p = .002). As seen in Table 3, z-test of proportion revealed each cable network similarly utilized experts from the energy industry (CNN 10.3%, Fox News 15.1%, MSNBC 9.3%) and fellow journalists (CNN 17.3%, Fox News 23.5%, MSNBC 17.6%) as sources in news reports. However, stories on Fox News featured a significantly higher proportion of current/former government officials as sources (43.7%) than did stories on CNN (31.4%) or MSNBC (28.7%). On the other hand, coverage on CNN and MSNBC more frequently featured citizens, celebrities, or activists (34.6%, 37%, respectively) than did Fox News (16.8%). Similarly, CNN and MSNBC included outside experts as sources more often (6.4%, 7.4%, respectively) than did Fox News (.8%).
The overarching goal of this study was to examine how U.S. cable news outlets have reported on fracking, an issue that the American public is divided on. Given the contentious nature of this controversial issue, limited knowledge of the drilling technique, and the partisan nature of cable news, coverage by CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC was examined to explore the breadth and depth of information provided by the media. Results suggest cable television news reports on fracking lack substance, but even the limited effort put into educating audiences varies by network. Although all three cable news outlets discuss the topic in generalized terms through thematically framed stories, each outlet selectively presents issues and differently utilizes sources. Overall, cable news outlets were found to paint sharply contrasting pictures of fracking that have the potential to prime audiences and influence future behaviors and/or judgments.

Results demonstrate that cable news networks are not providing coverage that enhances the public's limited knowledge about fracking, which is split along party lines [12], [23]. Specifically, assessment of definitional aspects of the process conveyed in stories showed that CNN provided more details of the hydraulic fracking process than other networks, especially Fox News. Taken together, it is apparent that fracking was explained superficially. All news stories were found to feature limited factual information that could aid audiences in understanding fracking. Such presentations may explain why public knowledge on the topic is limited [1], [24] and divided across ideological lines [6]. This suggests that the public does not receive the information needed to make objective assessments from U.S. cable news content.

As expected, reporting on fracking was dominated by thematic frames across cable news networks, demonstrating that nationally based U.S. news outlets may differ from coverage in locally based outlets in areas affected by fracking [61]. While all outlets examined here utilized thematic frames more than episodic frames in stories, Fox News and CNN featured a larger proportion of thematically framed stories. Although reliance on thematic framing may imply in-depth coverage [54], it may also be characteristic of the limited attention to specific experiences that help to “put a face” on the issue or provide access to how fracking affects individuals. Whereas episodic frames focus on individuals and discrete incidents, thematic frames place issues in a broader context and may consequently distance audiences from the issue [56]. The preponderance of thematic frames indicates that fracking is seen as a public issue and this type of news presentation leads viewers to consider the issue alongside governmental policies, which may be considered to be beyond their control. This aligns with research that has found the use of thematic framing in environmental news leads audiences to increase their support for policy aimed at addressing climate change [58].

It is important to note that few stories are ever completely thematic or episodic, rather the majority of stories are framed predominantly one way or the other [54]. However, Springer and Harwood [78] call for investigation into the effects of stories that equally feature elements of both episodic and thematic framing and existing research suggests that stories combining episodic and thematic frames are more effective in promoting attitude change than those that employ either [79]. Therefore, the strategic creation of media content that includes elements of both episodic and thematic framing could be a beneficial approach to issue advocates.

Reporting on issues related to hydraulic fracturing indicates that content producers selectively present topics that tend to align with a predetermined network-specific stance. With the exception of presenting the economic costs related to fracking, which was balanced across networks, coverage of issues differed across cable networks. Specifically, Fox News differed from other networks with coverage that was dominated by discussions supportive of hydraulic fracturing. This was evidenced by heavy coverage on energy independence, job growth, general economic benefits, and even potential environmental benefits related to fracking. This aligns with examination of news coverage in areas currently dealing with shale gas exploration, which found coverage focused heavily on benefits including job opportunities and the potential for revenue from leases and royalties [73]. Fox News coverage also featured a limited number of stories mentioning potential negative consequences associated with the extractive process including risks of seismic activity, pollution, water contamination, and the potential for human health risks. Emphasizing these issues essentially presents fracking as being environmentally friendly. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Fox News presents content that aligns with public relations materials distributed in support of hydraulic fracturing [69]. That is, by presenting news content that emphasizes economic benefits and ignores environmental costs, there appears to be an inherent aim to increase support for fracking [25].

On the other hand, news coverage on MSNBC included a disproportionately smaller amount of information about job growth associated with fracking activity compared to other networks. Further, stories on the network were found to include substantially more mentions of negative topics such as pollution and human health risks compared to coverage on CNN and Fox News. This type of coverage is in line with noted changes to MSNBC, which underwent a format switch and began offering more liberal content as a business strategy [80]. Mazur [5] noted that as arguments for and against fracking have intensified, the resulting controversy emphasizes fracking as inherently problematic, conflicting, or contentious. CNN appeared to toe the middle path in their fracking-related coverage of job growth, pollution, environmental benefits, and human health risks compared to other networks. Although CNN did not exclusively focus on either problematic or beneficial issues, coverage referred to hydraulic fracking as a “controversial” issue more than other cable outlets.

Overall, it appears that Fox News focused almost exclusively on the benefits of fracking while reporting on MSNBC placed greater emphasis on the hazards associated with fracking. Such systematic bias in media coverage of issues results in the reinforcement of perceptions, which may be misinformed [81], while attempting to appeal to their partisan audience base [32]. Unfortunately, this type of reporting prevents certain types of information from reaching and benefiting the public and key influencers depending on which channel they view [33]. These findings suggest sharply contrasting narratives on fracking are constructed by different cable networks, one of which appears to portray fracking in terms of great risk while the other portrays it in terms of great opportunity. This may have negative implications for policy formation and/or advancement because the public is likely to hold strong opinions based on misleading or incomplete information. Further, this type of reporting can result in deeper divisions rather than an informed citizenry. Being that agenda-setting guides public perception of issue importance and, subsequently, what information audiences use to make judgments about policy issues, such coverage has implications for how citizens make an informed judgment about energy policy. Since partisan media present different aspects of fracking, this could result in divisions in public opinion across party lines.

In regard to source of information, the only similarities across cable channels was seen in their disproportionately high reliance on fellow journalists and limited use of experts from the energy industry. The choice to utilize easily accessible sources, instead of reaching out to industry insiders with issue-specific knowledge, may explain the low definitional scores observed across news coverage. This is problematic considering the technical nature of fracking and the need to present it in clear, unambiguous terms to audiences. The use of experts in news reporting of technologies such as fracking is central to enhancing understanding and contributing to perceived credibility [82].

Considering both the observed variations in issue emphasis and source use, findings indicate that U.S. cable news outlets promote their predetermined positions on shale by selectively giving voice to different advocacy coalitions and interest groups. These actors, which include groups and individuals, champion select discourses while seeking to delegitimize others [46], [48], [49]. For instance, in news stories on fracking, CNN and MSNBC most frequently relied on citizens as sources in reporting. This included individuals who were personally afflicted by the extractive process, who appeared minimally on Fox News. Indeed, previous research has shown that sources play prominent roles in determining the dominant slant of news stories and are deliberately used to construct desired narratives [74], [83]. Specifically, the utilization of citizens as information sources by CNN and MSNBC may explain the prevalence of problematic aspects such as water contamination or seismic activity in their reporting on fracking. Although each network featured politicians and government officials as contributors to stories on fracking, Fox News coverage was dominated by these sources, suggesting the dominance of elite perspectives in its reports. Further, the abundant use of politicians on Fox News aligns with their emphasis on benefits such as job creation, energy independence, and general economic benefits.

In summary, the type of reporting seen in fracking-related coverage has the ability to sharpen pre-existing divisions between political ideologies. In other words, cable-news reporting can deepen partisan division on fracking, a topic that is already inadequately understood by many [84]. This reporting style raises important questions concerning the purpose of journalism. At its core, journalism works to provide the public with quality, objective, reliable information [85], [86]. This type of content is believed to enable individuals to be free and self-governing while also experiencing an increased quality of life [87], [88]. In essence, journalism aims to cultivate citizenry that is both knowledgeable and informed. Unfortunately, consequences of partisan reporting detract from this goal.

The current work is limited by only examining the portrayal of fracking on cable news. Due to the limited number of stories on nationally broadcast network news and accessibility issues associated with local news broadcasts led to the exclusion of both, which future research should consider including. Additionally, results of this work also lack the ability to draw conclusions about how audience views about fracking differ based on media use. Future research should incorporate experimental testing of messaging strategies that aim to capitalize on earned media coverage to garner public support for or against fracking. Matz and Renfrew [69] have suggested that social and political actors with diverse interests use a range of persuasive strategies in their media discourse regarding fracking. As such, future research may test message effectiveness as well as how the source of messages shape audience perspectives.

Despite the appeal of oil and gas exploration through hydraulic fracturing, the technique has been met with challenges and criticisms, as well as great promises and plaudits. Through this analysis of U.S. cable news coverage, results show that partisan news outlets selectively present fracking-related issues. Such topic selection choices may be responsible for splitting public opinion along party lines in the U.S. Further, news stories generally lack breadth and depth, which is needed to provide audiences with information necessary for understanding hydraulic fracturing. As the need for energy continues to rise, this topic will remain in the public eye. Therefore, there is a need for media to present well-rounded coverage that aims to inform audiences about this extraction technique devoid of partisan slant.
